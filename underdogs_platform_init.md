You are an elite AI fullstack engineer. Build from scratch the first version of the internal UnderDogs coordination platform.

🎯 PURPOSE:
A dark-themed internal web app for coordinating a team of developers, designers, and project collaborators. The system will include authentication, task/project tracking, announcements, and file sharing.

🧱 STACK:
Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS  
Backend: Python (FastAPI)  
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB  
Auth: JWT-based or FastAPI-Users (role-based access)

🌐 ROUTES/PAGES TO IMPLEMENT:
1. `/` – Pre-login portal gate (Moria-style challenge) ✅
2. `/auth` – Login/Register
3. `/dashboard` – Home for authenticated users
4. `/tasks` – Task list (filterable)
5. `/tasks/:id` – Task details with comments
6. `/announcements` – Team bulletin
7. `/files` – Shared docs/links
8. `/team` – Member status board

📦 BACKEND ENDPOINTS:
- `/api/auth/*` (register, login, logout)
- `/api/tasks/`
- `/api/announcements/`
- `/api/files/`
- `/api/users/`

🎨 DESIGN STYLE:
- Inspired by cyberpunk, brutalism, and Greek mythology
- Black background, red/white glow accents
- Sidebar navigation with glowing icons
- Neon typography, tech-metal textures

🎁 BONUS:
- Markdown-style editor for announcements
- Subtle ambient music toggle
- Seeded test data

Output: frontend folder, backend folder, README.md with install instructions.
